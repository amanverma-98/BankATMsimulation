**🏦 Bank ATM Simulation **                                     

This is a small Python project that simulates the working of an ATM machine using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
The system supports both Savings and Current accounts with features like deposits, withdrawals, overdraft (for current accounts), and automatic interest calculation (for savings accounts).




🚀 Features :

PIN verification (up to 3 wrong attempts allowed)

Check account balance

Deposit money

Withdraw money (with overdraft for current accounts)

Automatic interest addition for savings accounts

Multiple accounts can be added and managed




🔑 OOP Concepts Covered :

Encapsulation → sensitive data like PIN and balance kept private

Inheritance → account types (SavingsAccount, CurrentAccount) inherit from ATM

Polymorphism → withdraw() behaves differently for savings and current accounts

Abstraction → users interact with simple methods (deposit, withdraw, check balance) without seeing internal details




🛠️ Tech Used :

Python 3.12.4

Basic OOP principles
