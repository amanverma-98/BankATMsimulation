#BankATMSimulatiion

This is a small Python project that simulates the working of an ATM machine using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
The system supports both Savings and Current accounts with features like deposits, withdrawals, overdraft (for current accounts), and automatic interest calculation (for savings accounts).


Features :

PIN verification (up to 3 wrong attempts allowed)

Check account balance

Deposit money

Withdraw money (with overdraft for current accounts)

Automatic interest addition for savings accounts

Multiple accounts can be added and managed


OOP Concepts used: 

Encapsulation → sensitive data like PIN and balance kept private

Inheritance → account types (SavingsAccount, CurrentAccount) inherit from ATM

Polymorphism → withdraw() behaves differently for savings and current accounts

Abstraction → users interact with simple methods (deposit, withdraw, check balance) without seeing internal details


🛠️ Tech Used

Python 3.x

Basic OOP principles
